# 🖼️ Interactive Graphics – Homework Repository
Welcome to the homework repository for the **Interactive Graphics** course! This repo contains all the individual project submissions completed throughout the course. Each subdirectory corresponds to a different project and is named using the following convention:

```cpp
project{number}_{short-description}
```

# 📁 Structure
Each project folder includes:

* ✅ Source code

* 🎯 Task description (in comments or a README inside the folder)

* 📸 Screenshots or recordings (when required)

* 📄 Any relevant notes or documentation

Example:
``` python-repl
project1_rendering_pipeline/
project2_interaction_controls/
project3_shading_and_lighting/
...
```
# 🚀 Getting Started
To run any project:

1. Navigate into the desired ```project{number}_{description}``` folder:

``` bash
cd project1_ComposingImages
```
2. Follow the instructions in the README.md or comments in the code (if provided).

3. Ensure required libraries or frameworks (e.g., WebGL, Three.js, OpenGL, etc.) are installed if applicable.

# 🧠 About the Course
